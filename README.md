# Trivia Game Project

## Problem Domain
Our team is tentatively focusing on the problem domain of trivia games. Trivia games are a popular and entertaining way for people to test their knowledge on a wide range of topics. We believe that creating an engaging trivia application can provide users with a fun and educational experience.

## Project Description
We are considering developing a web trivia application that allows users to participate in trivia quizzes on various subjects. The application will have the following features:

1. **Trivia Quizzes**: Users can choose from a variety of trivia categories such as sports, movies, science, and more. Each category will have a collection of trivia quizzes.

2. **User Accounts**: Users can create accounts to track their progress, earn achievements, and compete with friends on leaderboards.

3. **Multiplayer Mode**: The application will support multiplayer mode, allowing users to challenge friends or random opponents in real-time trivia matches.

4. **Questions and Answers**: The app will present multiple-choice questions to users, and they will have a limited time to select the correct answer. Users will receive instant feedback on their answers.
